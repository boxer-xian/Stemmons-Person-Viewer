## Before starting run:
```
    pip install "Z:\Application Development\PIPInstall\FN_dev_package"

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    "./venv/Scripts/activate.bat"
```

## Guidelines:
Each tab will be its own class and page, with each sub-tab mapping to one class method. Classes should not load anything untill called by the user.

Each Tab should have its own css file, named the same name as the tab.
